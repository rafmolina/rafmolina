About Me:

I'm a cybersecurity major at Metropolitan State University of Denver, pursuing my passion for knowledge in computer science and feeding my deep curiosity for technology. My journey into the tech field began in 2021 when I completed a full-stack development program with BloomTech, which sparked my interest in programming and problem-solving. Since then, it's been all Milhouse.  

Full-Stack - Python, JavaScript, Java.

Linux Ubuntu & Windows OS.

Network+ Security+

Outside of computers, I enjoy playing soccer, helping my community, going to the gym, hanging out with my dogs, and watching movies/anime.
